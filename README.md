# GraphQL-Restaurant-Data-Exercise
This is an exercise for running GraphQL on a local machine. This example provides several restaurants, including name, description, dishes, and a unique id for doing the queries.

## How to Run:
Download index.js, package.json files. Make sure node is installed on your machine, and then run npm install to install necessary dependencies. Run node index.js and navigate to http://localhost:5500/graphql in your browser. View index.js in file editor to see possible queries that can be run to view, find, add, edit, and delete restaurant options.

## Roadmap:
This is a learning exercise, so adding more seems unnecessary at this point as it is simply the beginning of learning what can be done.
